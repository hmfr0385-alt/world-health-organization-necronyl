  <h2>Stage 1: Initial Healing (Days 1-7)</h2>
  <p>Upon administration of Necronyl, patients experience an immediate surge in their body’s healing processes. Damaged tissues and injuries begin to regenerate at an unnaturally fast rate, with cuts, bruises, and scars disappearing within days. This rapid healing is accompanied by a temporary increase in vitality, and patients report feeling more energetic than usual. While some may feel a general sense of well-being, many also experience mild discomfort, including skin rashes, irritation, and a warm sensation on the skin as new tissue forms. The immune system seems to be in overdrive, leading to a heightened metabolic state.</p>

  <h2>Stage 2: Hyper-Healing & Psychological Effects (Week 2-4)</h2>
  <p>As the treatment progresses, the initial healing response intensifies. Tissue regeneration accelerates to the point where excess tissue is produced, resulting in grotesque overgrowths of skin, muscle, and connective tissue, often leading to large, uneven bulges or deformities. This phenomenon, called "hyper-healing," is not only visible but also contributes to extreme discomfort as the body struggles to manage the rapid growth.</p>
  <p>Along with the physical symptoms, patients begin to show psychological side effects. Insomnia becomes prevalent, with many patients unable to sleep for extended periods, often due to heightened energy levels. Paranoia sets in, with patients becoming distrustful of others and experiencing irrational thoughts and delusions. The cognitive decline also begins during this stage, with many patients showing signs of memory impairment and a loss of reasoning skills. Violent outbursts and irritability become common, as individuals lose the ability to control their emotions or understand their actions.</p>

  <h2>Stage 3: Catatonia & Emergence of "Undead" Traits (Week 5-8)</h2>
  <p>At this stage, the infection begins to take a more sinister turn. Patients enter prolonged episodes of catatonia, during which they experience hours or even days of immobility. Their bodies become stiff, and they lose all higher brain function, entering a death-like state. During this period, their metabolic processes slow, and their organs appear to shut down, but they do not die. After a period of rigidity, they awaken in a state of primal aggression, driven by an overwhelming hunger. Their facial expressions become blank, and they no longer respond to external stimuli in a human-like way.</p>
  <p>Once they awaken, the infected exhibit an intense need to consume living beings, particularly flesh. Their aggression is uncontrollable, and they attack without any thought or emotion. The infected lose the ability to speak or reason, instead reacting purely based on instinct. Sensory deprivation, emotional responses, and social interaction are completely absent. The human mind essentially shuts down, leaving only the violent, predatory urges behind. Their regenerative abilities make them nearly indestructible, able to heal from injuries such as broken bones, severe burns, and deep cuts almost immediately.</p>

  <h2>Stage 4: Full Undead Transformation (Week 9 onwards)</h2>
  <p>By the ninth week, the infected have fully lost all human characteristics. They no longer resemble their former selves and have evolved into "undead" entities. Their bodies undergo a grotesque transformation, with their skin becoming leathery and decayed, and their eyes becoming clouded or bloodshot. Enhanced strength, speed, and reflexes are now the hallmark of the infected, enabling them to move with incredible force and agility despite their deteriorating physical condition. They show no signs of pain or fear, making them even more dangerous to approach or combat.</p>
  <p>Driven solely by basic instincts such as hunger, the infected are relentless in their pursuit of food. They can consume large quantities of flesh in a short period, and their regenerative abilities ensure that they will recover from almost any wound. The infected become impervious to conventional methods of defense, as their heightened regenerative abilities allow them to recover from fatal injuries, such as decapitation or dismemberment, within moments. While they are no longer able to reason or communicate, the infected remain organized in packs, driven by their shared need to hunt and consume. Their bodies are resilient to environmental conditions, making them nearly impossible to stop without extreme measures.</p>
  
  <h2>Stage 5: The Containment Stage (Weeks 12 onwards)</h2>
  <p>After several months, some infected individuals may begin to exhibit unusual patterns of behavior, seemingly retaining a level of adaptability. These infected might attempt to hide or avoid sunlight, and while still driven by basic needs, they may show signs of primitive intelligence, perhaps due to mutations in the brain. These are considered the most dangerous types of infected, as they possess the ability to work in unison to develop rudimentary strategies. Attempts to contain these individuals are ongoing, but the danger of full-scale outbreaks remains present.</p>
