      <h2>Neuro-Parasitic Persistence</h2>
      <p>
        Claire confirmed that Necronyl’s parasitic threads are not merely structural but store fragments of <strong>human neural activity</strong>. 
        Microscopic analysis showed echo-patterns resembling memory impulses, suggesting the infected may retain vestiges of thought. 
        Survivors exposed reported hearing voices of the dead — voices of loved ones. Delaunay warned that this may be the parasite using memory as a lure.

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Environmental Drift</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike other labs’ findings, Delaunay identified <strong>spore-like particulate forms</strong> of Necronyl drifting on wind currents. 
        She noted they were capable of adhering to surfaces for weeks, dormant until encountering organic tissue. 
        She concluded the parasite had achieved an airborne state of persistence, making sterilization of contaminated zones impossible.

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Behavioral Mimicry</h2>
      <p>
        In her later reports, Claire described infected outside the Institute exhibiting “unnatural patience.” 
        Instead of attacking barriers, some remained motionless, staring upward at observation windows for hours. 
        She theorized that Necronyl had begun <strong>studying human behavior</strong>, mimicking habits to unsettle the living and exploit psychological weakness.

        "The Institute is quiet now. Too quiet. I still hear their fists on the reinforced doors. I tell myself I did the right thing, that opening it would have killed us all. But when I close my eyes, I see their faces. I haven’t slept in days."

        "I marked my birthday today. Thirty-six. No candles, no voices. Just the hum of the generator. I sang 'Joyeux Anniversaire' softly to myself. I cried halfway through. I think I’m forgetting how it feels to be touched by another human being."

        "The radio is dead. I keep sending out calls anyway, whispering 'Pasteur, Paris, still alive.' Static answers me. Maybe someone will hear. Maybe no one’s left to listen. Sometimes I swear I hear whispers in the static. Familiar voices. They tell me I should have opened the door."

        "The food supply is nearly gone. I ration every crumb, but I dream of banquets. I dream of my mother’s cooking. I dream of their screams. I wrote formulas on my arms today, not because I need them — but because I need to believe I’m still a scientist, not just a ghost walking."

        "I saw one of them watching from the street below. Not stumbling, not moaning — just watching. When I turned, it was gone. I don’t know if it was real. I don’t know if I’m real."

        "I stopped writing for months. I couldn’t stand my own voice on paper. But I have to keep something, some record. If I die here, maybe someone will know I existed. I write on my arms now. Skin grows back, paper doesn’t."

        "I woke up to voices outside the barricade. Not inhuman growls — real voices. Survivors. They broke through the outer doors. I almost didn’t believe it. They said my name. They knew I was here. I don’t remember running to them, but I remember the warmth when they caught me. I’m not alone anymore."
