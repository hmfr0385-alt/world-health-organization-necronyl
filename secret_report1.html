      <h2>Genetic Structure of Necronyl</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike most known pathogens, Necronyl is neither a pure virus nor a conventional bacterium. It functions as a <strong>parasitic viral-hybrid organism</strong> that integrates into host DNA within hours of exposure. Genome sequencing revealed that Necronyl carries <em>modular gene clusters</em>, allowing it to rewrite large portions of the host’s immune and regenerative pathways. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These clusters are encoded with repeating DNA motifs that act like <strong>genetic switches</strong>, turning dormant human genes on and off at will. Early analysis suggests that many of these motifs bear resemblance to sequences found in ancient parasitic fungi, leading researchers to believe Necronyl may be a <strong>synthetic chimera</strong> rather than a naturally occurring organism.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Parasitic Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Once integrated, Necronyl functions less like a virus and more like a <strong>symbiotic parasite</strong>—though its “symbiosis” is fatally one-sided. The parasite establishes control over host mitochondria, diverting energy to fuel uncontrolled tissue regeneration. Hosts experience <strong>hypermetabolic surges</strong>, which initially mask infection as increased vitality before rapidly collapsing into necrosis and reanimation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Histological studies confirm that Necronyl-infected tissue grows <em>secondary vascular structures</em> resembling fungal mycelium, which thread through organs and bone marrow. These structures seem to serve as both nutrient highways and genetic relay networks, accelerating mutations across the host’s entire body.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Adaptive Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        Necronyl’s most alarming trait is its ability to <strong>adapt in real time</strong>. Each time the parasite encounters an attempted treatment, it triggers a wave of hypermutation within its modular gene clusters. This has made every experimental drug or inhibitor effective for no more than a few days before resistance develops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent sequencing efforts indicate that Necronyl doesn’t mutate blindly: the mutations appear <strong>directed</strong>. Nexus-3, the protein linked to regeneration, shows specific structural changes that neutralize whatever compound is introduced against it. This suggests an <strong>evolutionary intelligence</strong>, either programmed or emergent, that allows the parasite to “learn” from threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alarmingly, some mutations now include <strong>foreign genetic fragments</strong> not present in the original strain. Roth theorizes that Necronyl may be scavenging DNA from dead hosts—or even the environment itself—to patch and strengthen its genome.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Influence on Host Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond physical effects, Necronyl exhibits a profound <strong>neurological influence</strong>. EEG readings on early-stage infected individuals reveal synchronized electrical patterns inconsistent with normal brain activity. Infected subjects display compulsive aggression, reduced pain perception, and, in later stages, complete neural override by the parasite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Autopsies reveal Necronyl’s fungal-like vascular threads encasing the spinal cord and cerebellum, suggesting direct manipulation of motor and cognitive functions. Roth believes this is why the undead display coordinated movement long after cortical death.
