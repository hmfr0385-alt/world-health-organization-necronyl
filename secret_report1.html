      <h2>Livia Roth: Virologist and Chief of WHO Research</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Russia</p>
      <p>
        In early 2026, as the world collapsed under the weight of the Necronyl-induced apocalypse, Dr. Livia Roth, a WHO-appointed virologist and biomedical researcher, was dispatched to Moscow—the birthplace of the disastrous Necronyl cure. The Russian government had fallen, leaving only a few survivors in key research facilities. Despite the crumbling infrastructure, Roth managed to gain access to the Vector Institute, where Necronyl was first developed, just as the military checkpoints were falling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="research-container">
      <h2>Research Progress in Moscow</h2>
      <p>
        The underground laboratory, now her base of operations, is located beneath the Vector Institute in Moscow. For over a year, Roth and a handful of remaining scientists have continued to analyze Necronyl’s genetic structure and the mechanisms behind its terrifying side effects. However, supplies are running low, and the undead continue to roam freely outside the reinforced walls of the facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WHO research team is focused on reversing the effects of Necronyl by targeting its regenerative properties, but every attempt to neutralize the drug’s effects has been met with failure. The key challenge lies in the virus’s rapid mutation, which makes it difficult to predict and counteract effectively. The team’s efforts to develop a compound that could halt the excessive tissue regeneration have been unsuccessful, as the undead remain resilient against almost every treatment.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Research Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetic Reprogramming:</strong> Investigating the potential for reversing the gene-editing effects of Necronyl, but the virus constantly evolves, complicating the development of a vaccine or cure.</li>
        <li><strong>Necronyl Inhibitors:</strong> Searching for pharmaceutical compounds that can block Necronyl's hyper-healing effect, but clinical tests in the limited space of the lab have shown minimal results.</li>
        <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Exploring ways to retrain the immune system to identify and destroy Necronyl-affected cells without triggering further mutations in the undead.</li>
        <li><strong>Necronyl’s Origins:</strong> The team has also begun studying the origins of Necronyl, specifically how the drug was able to reprogram the immune system in the first place, which may offer clues to its undoing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        With dwindling resources, including access to vital medical supplies and research equipment, Roth’s team faces constant pressure. As of late 2027, communication networks have collapsed, and the outside world remains unreachable. Roth’s team is isolated, both from the global scientific community and the outside world. The only communication available is through precarious, short-range radio signals, making collaboration with outside organizations nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, Livia Roth remains determined to continue her work. The last few surviving scientists in the lab have become like family, working side by side in a grim race against time to stop Necronyl’s devastating effects.

      <h2>Researcher's Journal: Livia Roth</h2>
      <p class="research-notes">
        <strong>Entry Date: January 15, 2027</strong><br>
        "Supplies are running low. I am still holding on to the hope that our work can reverse Necronyl's effects. Every failed attempt feels like a step backward, but I cannot stop. The world outside is collapsing, and if we fail here, the consequences will be unimaginable. I am not just working to save lives—I am working to save humanity itself."
