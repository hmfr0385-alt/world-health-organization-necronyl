    <h2>1. Headshots (Brain Destruction)</h2>
    <p>Targeting the brain remains the most effective way to neutralize the infected. The brain is the central command of all actions, even for the undead. Destruction of the brain through high-impact weapons (e.g., firearms, blunt-force trauma) renders the undead completely incapable of functioning, even with their regenerative abilities. It is important to aim directly at the skull, as the regenerative tissue can often repair superficial wounds, but a destroyed brain is irreversible.</p>

    <h2>2. Extreme Heat</h2>
    <p>Using fire-based weapons, such as flamethrowers or explosive incendiary devices, can overwhelm the infected's regenerative capacity. Intense heat not only prevents them from healing but also causes irreversible cell destruction. Fire is one of the most reliable methods for mass destruction of infected hordes, as it bypasses their regenerative resistance. However, handling fire requires caution as uncontrolled flames can cause widespread damage and harm survivors.</p>

    <h2>3. Toxins and Poisons</h2>
    <p>Certain chemicals or biological agents can interfere with the regenerative process of the infected. These substances target the cellular regeneration mechanisms or disrupt the viral strain causing the mutation. Though not widely available, research on toxin-based weapons has become critical. Poisonous gases, engineered diseases, or biologically engineered agents that cause cell breakdown can render the undead vulnerable. These toxins can be released into the environment in contained areas but must be used carefully to avoid collateral damage to non-infected survivors.</p>

    <h2>4. Heavy Weaponry and High-Velocity Rounds</h2>
    <p>Weapons designed to generate extreme kinetic force, such as high-caliber rounds, explosive projectiles, or artillery, can tear apart the infected’s regenerative tissue. A direct hit with a high-velocity round can temporarily stop their healing process, especially when aiming at the heart or upper torso. These rounds can cause extensive damage, even decapitation or dismemberment, which further prevents regeneration. The effectiveness of this method depends on the firepower and precision of the weapon used, making it more suitable for large-scale military engagement rather than individual combat.</p>

    <h2>5. Cryogenic Freezing</h2>
    <p>Freezing the infected is a highly effective strategy that halts the regenerative process by severely lowering their body temperature. Cryogenic weapons or environments that induce extreme cold slow down or completely stop the infected's ability to heal. Freezing the infected causes their bodily functions to freeze in place, leaving them in an inert state. However, this method is more useful for containment and temporary neutralization. Prolonged exposure to extreme cold can also have detrimental effects on local ecosystems and infrastructure, and thawing could lead to potential reactivation.</p>

    <h2>6. Environmental Hazards</h2>
    <p>Radioactive zones or toxic atmospheres can render the infected unable to regenerate, as exposure to such environments damages their cellular structure. Radiation disrupts the DNA structure of the infected, hindering their regenerative capacity. These methods can be used to contain or even exterminate large groups of infected individuals, especially in urban areas where evacuation is difficult. While effective in certain areas, the long-term environmental damage caused by radiation or toxins could render entire regions uninhabitable, making this a double-edged sword. </p>

    <h2>7. Specialized Military Operations (Covert Tactics)</h2>
    <p>Military operations targeting key infected strongholds or high-density groups using specialized tactics can significantly reduce the undead's population. Stealthy, covert operations using small, highly trained teams with advanced gear (e.g., silenced weapons, tactical explosives) can neutralize infected individuals without drawing attention to nearby survivors. Such operations are highly resource-intensive but are effective in eliminating key threats and slowing the spread. These teams often rely on environmental cover and speed, striking before the infected can regroup or spread further.</p>

    <h2>8. Neural Disruptors (Experimental Technology)</h2>
    <p>One of the latest breakthroughs in research involves using neural disruptors—devices that emit high-frequency signals to interfere with the infected's brain activity. These signals can potentially cause the infected to lose motor function, rendering them immobile. However, this technology is still in its experimental phase and has been limited in field testing due to its reliance on delicate and high-energy equipment. While promising, neural disruptors may not be a fully reliable option until further research is completed.</p>
